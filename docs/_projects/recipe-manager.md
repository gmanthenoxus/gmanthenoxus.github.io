# Smart Recipe Manager

An intelligent culinary companion that transforms how you discover, organize, and execute recipes with AI-powered features that adapt to your cooking style and dietary preferences.

## The Problem

Traditional recipe apps are static databases that don't adapt to your needs. They can't scale recipes intelligently, suggest substitutions for missing ingredients, or help you cook hands-free in the kitchen. Managing a personal recipe collection across multiple sources is chaotic and inefficient.

## The Solution

Built a comprehensive system that:
- **Intelligently scales recipes** with proper ratio adjustments for different serving sizes
- **Suggests smart substitutions** based on available ingredients and dietary restrictions
- **Generates optimized shopping lists** with store layout integration and price tracking
- **Provides hands-free cooking** with voice commands and audio guidance

## Key Features

### 🧠 **Intelligent Recipe Processing**
- Automatic ingredient scaling with ratio-aware adjustments
- Smart substitution engine using culinary science principles
- Nutritional analysis with macro and micronutrient tracking
- Difficulty assessment and time estimation based on techniques used

### 🗣️ **Voice-Controlled Cooking**
- Hands-free recipe navigation with voice commands
- Audio step-by-step instructions with timing cues
- Ingredient measurement conversion on demand
- Timer management with multiple simultaneous timers

### 🛒 **Smart Shopping Integration**
- Automated shopping list generation with quantity optimization
- Store layout integration for efficient shopping routes
- Price tracking and budget management across multiple stores
- Pantry inventory management with expiration date tracking

### 📊 **Personalized Insights**
- Cooking pattern analysis and skill progression tracking
- Dietary goal monitoring with nutritional recommendations
- Recipe success rating and personal note integration
- Meal planning with automated variety and nutrition balancing

## Technical Implementation

### **Recipe Scaling Algorithm**
```javascript
// Intelligent recipe scaling with ratio awareness
class RecipeScaler {
    constructor() {
        this.conversionRules = this.loadConversionRules();
        this.ratioSensitiveIngredients = [
            'baking_powder', 'baking_soda', 'salt', 'spices', 'vanilla'
        ];
    }

    scaleRecipe(recipe, targetServings) {
        const scaleFactor = targetServings / recipe.originalServings;
        const scaledIngredients = [];

        for (const ingredient of recipe.ingredients) {
            let scaledAmount;
            
            if (this.isRatioSensitive(ingredient.name)) {
                // Use logarithmic scaling for ratio-sensitive ingredients
                scaledAmount = this.logarithmicScale(
                    ingredient.amount, scaleFactor
                );
            } else {
                // Linear scaling for most ingredients
                scaledAmount = ingredient.amount * scaleFactor;
            }

            // Round to practical measurements
            scaledAmount = this.roundToPracticalMeasurement(
                scaledAmount, ingredient.unit
            );

            scaledIngredients.push({
                ...ingredient,
                amount: scaledAmount,
                originalAmount: ingredient.amount
            });
        }

        return {
            ...recipe,
            servings: targetServings,
            ingredients: scaledIngredients,
            scaleFactor: scaleFactor
        };
    }

    logarithmicScale(amount, factor) {
        // Ratio-sensitive ingredients don't scale linearly
        // Use logarithmic scaling to prevent over-seasoning
        return amount * Math.pow(factor, 0.7);
    }
}
```

### **Substitution Engine**
```python
# AI-powered ingredient substitution system
class SubstitutionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ingredient_database = self.load_ingredient_database()
        self.substitution_rules = self.load_substitution_rules()
        self.flavor_profiles = self.load_flavor_profiles()
    
    def suggest_substitutions(self, missing_ingredient, recipe_context):
        # Analyze the role of the ingredient in the recipe
        ingredient_role = self.analyze_ingredient_role(
            missing_ingredient, recipe_context
        )
        
        # Find potential substitutes based on function
        functional_substitutes = self.find_functional_substitutes(
            missing_ingredient, ingredient_role
        )
        
        # Score substitutes based on flavor compatibility
        scored_substitutes = []
        for substitute in functional_substitutes:
            flavor_score = self.calculate_flavor_compatibility(
                substitute, recipe_context['flavor_profile']
            )
            
            availability_score = self.check_pantry_availability(substitute)
            
            total_score = (flavor_score * 0.6) + (availability_score * 0.4)
            
            scored_substitutes.append({
                'ingredient': substitute,
                'score': total_score,
                'ratio': self.calculate_substitution_ratio(
                    missing_ingredient, substitute
                ),
                'notes': self.generate_substitution_notes(
                    missing_ingredient, substitute
                )
            })
        
        return sorted(scored_substitutes, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)
    
    def analyze_ingredient_role(self, ingredient, recipe_context):
        roles = []
        
        # Analyze based on recipe type and cooking method
        if recipe_context['type'] == 'baking':
            if ingredient in ['flour', 'almond_flour', 'coconut_flour']:
                roles.append('structure')
            elif ingredient in ['butter', 'oil', 'coconut_oil']:
                roles.append('fat_moisture')
        
        # Analyze based on flavor contribution
        if ingredient in self.flavor_profiles:
            roles.append('flavor_primary')
        
        return roles
```

### **Voice Control System**
```javascript
// Voice command processing for hands-free cooking
class VoiceController {
    constructor() {
        this.recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
        this.synthesis = window.speechSynthesis;
        this.commands = this.initializeCommands();
        this.currentStep = 0;
        this.timers = new Map();
    }

    initializeCommands() {
        return {
            'next step': () => this.nextStep(),
            'previous step': () => this.previousStep(),
            'repeat step': () => this.repeatCurrentStep(),
            'set timer': (duration) => this.setTimer(duration),
            'how much': (ingredient) => this.getIngredientAmount(ingredient),
            'substitute': (ingredient) => this.suggestSubstitution(ingredient),
            'convert': (measurement) => this.convertMeasurement(measurement)
        };
    }

    processVoiceCommand(transcript) {
        const command = this.parseCommand(transcript.toLowerCase());
        
        if (command.action in this.commands) {
            const result = this.commands[command.action](command.parameter);
            this.speakResponse(result.message);
            return result;
        } else {
            this.speakResponse("I didn't understand that command. Try saying 'help' for available commands.");
        }
    }

    setTimer(duration) {
        const timerId = Date.now().toString();
        const durationMs = this.parseDuration(duration);
        
        this.timers.set(timerId, {
            duration: durationMs,
            startTime: Date.now(),
            description: `Timer for ${duration}`
        });

        setTimeout(() => {
            this.speakResponse(`Timer for ${duration} is complete!`);
            this.timers.delete(timerId);
        }, durationMs);

        return {
            success: true,
            message: `Timer set for ${duration}`
        };
    }
}
```
