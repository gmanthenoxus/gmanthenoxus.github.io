## Abstract

This project aims to analyze anime genre distributions, popularity trends, and personal viewing patterns through an interactive dashboard. By leveraging data from MyAnimeList and applying statistical analysis techniques, we'll identify patterns in genre evolution and discover underrated anime that match user preferences.

**Status**: This project is in the planning phase. Detailed findings and visualizations will be added as work progresses.

## Research Questions

1. How do anime genre distributions change over time?
2. What patterns exist in the relationship between genre, popularity, and ratings?
3. Can we identify underrated anime before they gain mainstream recognition?
4. How do personal viewing patterns correlate with broader genre trends?
