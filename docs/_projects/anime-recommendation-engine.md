## Project Overview

The Anime Recommendation Engine is an ambitious machine learning project that aims to solve the age-old problem of "what should I watch next?" for anime enthusiasts. By combining collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning techniques, this system will provide highly personalized recommendations that go beyond simple genre matching.

## The Problem

With over 15,000 anime titles available and new releases every season, anime fans often struggle to discover content that matches their specific tastes. Current recommendation systems are either too generic or rely solely on popularity metrics, missing the nuanced preferences that make anime consumption so personal.

## Technical Approach

### Data Collection Strategy
- **MyAnimeList API**: Primary source for anime metadata, ratings, and user preferences
- **Anilist GraphQL API**: Secondary source for additional metadata and user interactions
- **Web Scraping**: Supplementary data from anime databases and review sites
- **User-Generated Content**: Ratings, reviews, and watch lists from beta users

### Machine Learning Architecture

#### 1. Collaborative Filtering
```python
# Matrix factorization using SVD
from surprise import SVD, Dataset, Reader

# User-item rating matrix
reader = Reader(rating_scale=(1, 10))
data = Dataset.load_from_df(ratings_df[['user_id', 'anime_id', 'rating']], reader)

# Train SVD model
model = SVD(n_factors=100, n_epochs=20, lr_all=0.005, reg_all=0.02)
model.fit(trainset)
```

#### 2. Content-Based Filtering
- **Genre Analysis**: Multi-hot encoding of anime genres
- **Studio Preferences**: Historical user preferences for animation studios
- **Demographic Targeting**: Age ratings and target audience analysis
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Release season and year preferences

#### 3. Deep Learning Enhancement
```python
# Neural collaborative filtering
import tensorflow as tf

class NCF(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, num_users, num_items, embedding_size=50):
        super(NCF, self).__init__()
        self.user_embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(num_users, embedding_size)
        self.item_embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(num_items, embedding_size)
        self.dense_layers = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
        ])
```

## System Architecture

### Backend Services
- **FastAPI**: High-performance API server with automatic documentation
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for user data and anime metadata
- **Redis**: Caching layer for real-time recommendations
- **Celery**: Asynchronous task processing for model training

### Frontend Application
- **React**: Modern, responsive user interface
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **React Query**: Efficient data fetching and caching

### Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
- **AWS/Heroku**: Cloud hosting (TBD)
- **Monitoring**: Application performance and error tracking

## Key Features

### For Users
- **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions based on viewing history
- **Advanced Filtering**: Genre, studio, year, rating, and length filters
- **Watch List Management**: Track planned, watching, and completed anime
- **Rating System**: 10-point rating scale with optional reviews
- **Social Features**: Follow friends and see their recommendations

### For Developers
- **RESTful API**: Clean, documented endpoints for third-party integration
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live recommendations
- **A/B Testing**: Built-in experimentation framework
- **Analytics Dashboard**: User behavior and recommendation performance metrics

## Development Challenges

### Data Quality
- **Inconsistent Metadata**: Different sources use varying formats and classifications
- **Sparse Ratings**: Many anime have few user ratings, creating cold start problems
- **Bias Handling**: Popular anime dominate recommendations without proper balancing

### Technical Challenges
- **Scalability**: System must handle thousands of concurrent users
- **Cold Start Problem**: Recommendations for new users with no history
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-200ms response times for recommendation requests
- **Model Drift**: Continuous retraining as user preferences evolve

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- **Click-through Rate**: >15% on recommended anime
- **Watch Completion Rate**: >60% for recommended titles
- **User Retention**: >70% monthly active users
- **Rating Accuracy**: <1.5 RMSE on user ratings

### Technical Performance
- **API Response Time**: <200ms for recommendation requests
- **System Uptime**: >99.5% availability
- **Model Accuracy**: >85% precision on top-10 recommendations
- **Data Freshness**: <24 hours for new anime integration

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- **Mobile Application**: Native iOS and Android apps
- **Seasonal Recommendations**: Suggestions based on current anime season
- **Mood-Based Filtering**: Recommendations based on current emotional state
- **Group Recommendations**: Suggestions for watching with friends

### Advanced ML Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze review text for deeper preference understanding
- **Image Recognition**: Visual similarity matching for anime artwork
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Account for changing user preferences over time
- **Cross-Domain Recommendations**: Suggest manga, light novels, and games

## Community Impact

This project aims to enhance the anime discovery experience for fans worldwide while contributing to the open-source machine learning community. By sharing our research and methodologies, we hope to advance the field of recommendation systems and inspire similar projects in other entertainment domains.

The system will also provide valuable insights into anime consumption patterns, potentially helping studios and distributors make more informed content decisions.
