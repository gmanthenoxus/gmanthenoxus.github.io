# Digital Board Game Platform

A comprehensive web platform that brings the social experience of board gaming to the digital world, complete with intelligent AI opponents and seamless multiplayer functionality.

## The Problem

Physical board games require coordination, physical presence, and significant setup time. During the pandemic and with friends scattered globally, maintaining regular game nights became nearly impossible. Existing digital platforms are limited in game selection, lack intelligent AI, or provide poor user experiences.

## The Solution

Built a comprehensive platform that:
- **Recreates beloved board games** with pixel-perfect digital implementations
- **Provides intelligent AI opponents** that adapt to player skill levels
- **Enables seamless multiplayer** with real-time synchronization across devices
- **Maintains game state** allowing players to pause and resume games across sessions

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ® **Game Library**
- **Classic Games**: Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, Splendor, Azul
- **Modern Favorites**: Wingspan, 7 Wonders, King of Tokyo
- **Party Games**: Codenames, Just One, Wavelength
- **Strategy Games**: Terraforming Mars, Scythe, Gloomhaven (planned)

### ðŸ¤– **Intelligent AI System**
- Adaptive difficulty that learns from player behavior
- Multiple AI personalities with different play styles
- Strategic decision-making using game theory algorithms
- Realistic timing to simulate human-like play patterns

### ðŸ‘¥ **Multiplayer Features**
- Real-time synchronization with sub-100ms latency
- Voice and video chat integration
- Spectator mode for watching games in progress
- Tournament and league organization tools

### ðŸ“± **Cross-Platform Experience**

- Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline play
- Game state synchronization across multiple devices
- Touch-optimized controls for mobile gameplay

## Technical Implementation

### **Real-Time Game Engine**
```javascript
// Example of the game state management system
class GameEngine {
    constructor(gameType, players) {
        this.gameType = gameType;
        this.players = players;
        this.gameState = this.initializeGame();
        this.actionHistory = [];
        this.io = require('socket.io')(server);
    }

    processAction(playerId, action) {
        // Validate action legality
        if (!this.isValidAction(playerId, action)) {
            return { success: false, error: 'Invalid action' };
        }

        // Apply action to game state
        const previousState = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(this.gameState));
        this.gameState = this.applyAction(this.gameState, action);
        
        // Record action in history
        this.actionHistory.push({
            playerId,
            action,
            timestamp: Date.now(),
            previousState
        });

        // Check for game end conditions
        const gameResult = this.checkGameEnd(this.gameState);
        
        // Broadcast state update to all players
        this.broadcastStateUpdate();

        return { 
            success: true, 
            newState: this.gameState,
            gameResult 
        };
    }

    broadcastStateUpdate() {
        this.io.to(this.gameId).emit('gameStateUpdate', {
            gameState: this.gameState,
            currentPlayer: this.getCurrentPlayer(),
            validActions: this.getValidActions()
        });
    }
}
```

### **AI Decision Making**
```python
# Example of AI opponent for Settlers of Catan
class CatanAI:
    def __init__(self, difficulty='medium', personality='balanced'):
        self.difficulty = difficulty
        self.personality = personality
        self.strategy_weights = self.load_personality_weights(personality)
    
    def make_decision(self, game_state, valid_actions):
        # Analyze current board position
        board_analysis = self.analyze_board_state(game_state)
        
        # Calculate action values based on strategy
        action_values = {}
        for action in valid_actions:
            action_values[action] = self.evaluate_action(
                action, game_state, board_analysis
            )
        
        # Add personality-based modifications
        action_values = self.apply_personality_modifiers(action_values)
        
        # Select action based on difficulty level
        if self.difficulty == 'easy':
            return self.select_action_with_mistakes(action_values)
        elif self.difficulty == 'hard':
            return self.select_optimal_action(action_values)
        else:
            return self.select_good_action_with_variation(action_values)
    
    def evaluate_action(self, action, game_state, board_analysis):
        score = 0
        
        # Resource acquisition value
        if action['type'] == 'build_settlement':
            score += self.calculate_resource_value(action['position'])
        
        # Strategic positioning
        score += self.calculate_strategic_value(action, game_state)
        
        # Blocking opponents
        score += self.calculate_blocking_value(action, game_state)
        
        # Victory point progression
        score += self.calculate_vp_value(action, game_state)
        
        return score * self.strategy_weights.get(action['type'], 1.0)
```
