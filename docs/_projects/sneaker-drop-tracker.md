# Sneaker Drop Tracker

Never miss another limited sneaker release with this comprehensive tracking system that monitors dozens of retailers and sends instant notifications when your grails become available.

## The Problem

The sneaker game moves fast. Limited releases sell out in seconds, restocks happen without warning, and price drops occur randomly. Manually checking multiple apps and websites throughout the day is time-consuming and ineffective, leading to missed opportunities on coveted releases.

## The Solution

Built a comprehensive monitoring system that:
- **Tracks 25+ retailers** including Nike SNKRS, Adidas, StockX, GOAT, and boutique stores
- **Sends instant notifications** via push notifications, SMS, and email
- **Monitors multiple data points** including releases, restocks, price changes, and raffle openings
- **Provides customizable filters** for brands, sizes, price ranges, and specific models

## Key Features

### 🔍 **Comprehensive Monitoring**
- Real-time tracking of Nike SNKRS, Adidas Confirmed, and 20+ other platforms
- Automated detection of new releases, restocks, and surprise drops
- Price monitoring across resale platforms (StockX, GOAT, eBay)
- Raffle and draw monitoring for limited releases

### 📱 **Smart Notifications**
- Instant push notifications with customizable sound alerts
- SMS notifications for high-priority releases
- Email summaries with detailed release information
- Notification scheduling to avoid alerts during sleep hours

### ⚙️ **Advanced Filtering**
- Brand-specific filters (Jordan, Yeezy, Dunk, etc.)
- Size-based filtering with half-size precision
- Price range customization for budget management
- Keyword alerts for specific colorways or collaborations

### 📊 **Analytics Dashboard**

- Price history charts for informed purchasing decisions
- Release calendar with upcoming drops
- Personal collection integration and wishlist management

## Technical Implementation

### **Web Scraping Engine**
```javascript
// Example of the Nike SNKRS monitoring system
class SNKRSMonitor {
    constructor() {
        this.baseUrl = 'https://api.nike.com/product_feed/threads/v2';
        this.headers = {
            'User-Agent': 'SNKRS/4.6.0 (iPhone; iOS 15.0; Scale/3.00)',
            'Accept': 'application/json'
        };
    }

    async checkForNewReleases() {
        try {
            const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}?filter=marketplace(US)&filter=language(en)&filter=upcoming(true)`, {
                headers: this.headers
            });
            
            const data = await response.json();
            const newReleases = this.filterNewReleases(data.objects);
            
            for (const release of newReleases) {
                await this.processNewRelease(release);
            }
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('SNKRS monitoring error:', error);
        }
    }

    async processNewRelease(release) {
        const notification = {
            title: release.productInfo[0].productContent.title,
            price: release.productInfo[0].merchPrice.currentPrice,
            releaseDate: release.publishedContent.properties.releaseDate,
            imageUrl: release.productInfo[0].imageUrls.productImageUrl,
            retailer: 'Nike SNKRS'
        };

        await this.sendNotifications(notification);
        await this.saveToDatabase(notification);
    }
}
```
