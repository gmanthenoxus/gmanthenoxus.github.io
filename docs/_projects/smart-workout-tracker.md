# Smart Workout Tracker

An intelligent fitness companion that goes beyond simple rep counting to provide personalized insights, form analysis, and predictive recommendations for optimal training progression.

## The Problem

Traditional fitness apps are glorified spreadsheets that track what you did, not what you should do next. They can't analyze your form, predict when you'll plateau, or understand the complex relationships between different exercises, recovery, and performance.

## The Solution

Built an AI-powered system that:
- **Analyzes workout patterns** using machine learning to identify trends and optimization opportunities
- **Provides form feedback** through computer vision analysis of exercise execution
- **Predicts plateaus** before they happen and suggests program modifications
- **Personalizes recommendations** based on individual response patterns and goals

## Key Features

### 🧠 **Intelligent Analysis**
- Machine learning algorithms that analyze workout patterns and progression
- Predictive modeling to forecast performance plateaus 2-3 weeks in advance
- Personalized volume and intensity recommendations based on recovery metrics
- Exercise selection optimization based on individual response patterns

### 📹 **Computer Vision Form Analysis**
- Real-time form analysis using smartphone camera and MediaPipe
- Instant feedback on exercise execution with specific correction suggestions
- Range of motion tracking and consistency scoring
- Injury risk assessment based on movement patterns

### 📊 **Advanced Metrics**
- Volume load progression tracking with statistical analysis
- Recovery metrics integration (HRV, sleep quality, subjective wellness)
- Strength curve analysis to identify weak points in lifts
- Performance prediction modeling with confidence intervals

### 🎯 **Personalized Programming**
- Adaptive program modification based on performance data
- Deload week timing optimization using fatigue indicators
- Exercise substitution recommendations for plateau breaking
- Goal-specific periodization with automatic adjustments

## Technical Implementation

### **Machine Learning Pipeline**
```python
# Example of the plateau prediction algorithm
class PlateauPredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = self.load_trained_model()
        self.feature_extractor = FeatureExtractor()
    
    def predict_plateau_risk(self, user_data):
        # Extract relevant features
        features = self.feature_extractor.extract_features(user_data)
        
        # Features include:
        # - Recent performance trends
        # - Volume progression rate
        # - Recovery metrics
        # - Training frequency patterns
        
        plateau_probability = self.model.predict_proba([features])[0][1]
        
        if plateau_probability > 0.7:
            recommendations = self.generate_recommendations(user_data, features)
            return {
                'risk_level': 'high',
                'probability': plateau_probability,
                'recommendations': recommendations,
                'timeline': '2-3 weeks'
            }
        
        return {'risk_level': 'low', 'probability': plateau_probability}
    
    def generate_recommendations(self, user_data, features):
        recommendations = []
        
        if features['volume_increase_rate'] > 0.15:
            recommendations.append({
                'type': 'volume_reduction',
                'message': 'Consider reducing volume by 20% next week',
                'reasoning': 'Rapid volume increases detected'
            })
        
        if features['recovery_score'] < 0.6:
            recommendations.append({
                'type': 'deload',
                'message': 'Schedule a deload week within 7 days',
                'reasoning': 'Recovery metrics indicate accumulated fatigue'
            })
        
        return recommendations
```

### **Computer Vision Form Analysis**
```javascript
// Real-time form analysis using MediaPipe
class FormAnalyzer {
    constructor() {
        this.pose = new Pose({
            locateFile: (file) => `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/pose/${file}`
        });
        
        this.pose.setOptions({
            modelComplexity: 1,
            smoothLandmarks: true,
            enableSegmentation: false,
            smoothSegmentation: false,
            minDetectionConfidence: 0.5,
            minTrackingConfidence: 0.5
        });
    }

    analyzeSquatForm(landmarks) {
        const analysis = {
            kneeTracking: this.analyzeKneeTracking(landmarks),
            hipDepth: this.analyzeHipDepth(landmarks),
            spineNeutrality: this.analyzeSpinePosition(landmarks),
            overallScore: 0
        };

        // Calculate overall form score
        analysis.overallScore = (
            analysis.kneeTracking.score * 0.4 +
            analysis.hipDepth.score * 0.4 +
            analysis.spineNeutrality.score * 0.2
        );

        return analysis;
    }

    analyzeKneeTracking(landmarks) {
        const leftKnee = landmarks[25];
        const rightKnee = landmarks[26];
        const leftAnkle = landmarks[27];
        const rightAnkle = landmarks[28];

        // Calculate knee valgus/varus
        const kneeAlignment = this.calculateKneeAlignment(
            leftKnee, rightKnee, leftAnkle, rightAnkle
        );

        return {
            score: kneeAlignment > 0.8 ? 1.0 : kneeAlignment,
            feedback: kneeAlignment < 0.7 ? 
                "Keep knees tracking over toes" : 
                "Good knee alignment"
        };
    }
