# Smart Workout Tracker

An intelligent fitness companion that uses AI and computer vision to analyze your workouts, provide real-time form feedback, and optimize your training for maximum results.

## 🎯 The Problem

Traditional workout tracking apps are passive data collectors that miss crucial insights:
- No analysis of workout quality or form
- Generic programs that don't adapt to individual progress
- No prediction of plateaus or overtraining
- Limited integration with actual performance data
- Lack of intelligent progression recommendations

## 💡 The Solution

I'm building an AI-powered system that:
- Uses computer vision to analyze exercise form in real-time
- Predicts optimal training loads based on performance patterns
- Identifies plateau risks before they happen
- Provides personalized program adjustments
- Integrates with wearables for comprehensive health monitoring

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Computer Vision**: MediaPipe for pose estimation

### Key Features
- **Form Analysis**: Real-time feedback on exercise technique
- **Smart Progression**: AI-driven load and volume recommendations
- **Plateau Prediction**: Early warning system for training stagnation
- **Recovery Optimization**: Sleep and HRV integration for training readiness
- **Social Features**: Community challenges and form check sharing

## 📊 Current Development Status

- **Beta Testing**: 50+ users providing feedback on form analysis
- **Computer Vision**: 85% accuracy in exercise recognition
- **Prediction Models**: 78% accuracy in plateau prediction
- **Target Launch**: Q2 2025 for iOS and Android

## 🎨 AI & Computer Vision Pipeline

### Exercise Recognition
```python
class ExerciseClassifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pose_detector = mp.solutions.pose.Pose()
        self.exercise_model = load_model('exercise_classifier.tflite')
    
    def analyze_movement(self, video_frame):
        # Extract pose landmarks
        pose_landmarks = self.pose_detector.process(video_frame)
        
        # Calculate joint angles and movement patterns
        features = self.extract_biomechanical_features(pose_landmarks)
        
        # Classify exercise and analyze form
        exercise_type = self.exercise_model.predict(features)
        form_score = self.analyze_form_quality(features, exercise_type)
        
        return {
            'exercise': exercise_type,
            'form_score': form_score,
            'corrections': self.generate_corrections(features)
        }
```

### Performance Prediction
```python
class PerformancePredictionModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = tf.keras.models.load_model('performance_model.h5')
        self.scaler = joblib.load('feature_scaler.pkl')
    
    def predict_plateau(self, workout_history):
        # Feature engineering from workout data
        features = self.engineer_features(workout_history)
        scaled_features = self.scaler.transform(features)
        
        # Predict plateau probability
        plateau_risk = self.model.predict(scaled_features)
        
        # Generate recommendations
        recommendations = self.generate_recommendations(
            plateau_risk, workout_history
        )
        
        return {
            'plateau_risk': plateau_risk,
            'recommendations': recommendations,
            'confidence': self.calculate_confidence(features)
        }
```

### Form Correction System
```python
def analyze_squat_form(pose_landmarks):
    """Analyze squat form and provide corrections"""
    angles = calculate_joint_angles(pose_landmarks)
    
    corrections = []
    
    # Check knee tracking
    if angles['knee_valgus'] > KNEE_VALGUS_THRESHOLD:
        corrections.append({
            'issue': 'Knee cave',
            'correction': 'Focus on pushing knees out',
            'severity': 'high'
        })
    
    # Check depth
    if angles['hip_angle'] > SQUAT_DEPTH_THRESHOLD:
        corrections.append({
            'issue': 'Insufficient depth',
            'correction': 'Descend until hip crease below knee',
            'severity': 'medium'
        })
    
    return corrections
```
