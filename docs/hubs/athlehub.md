backstory: |
  Growing up, basketball was a big part of my life. I'd go out with my friends to play pickup games, but we kept running into the same frustrating problems:

  Sometimes I'd get to the court and find it completely empty. Other times, I'd hear about a pickup event or mini-league too late. During games, scores were lost, or stats weren't tracked. Even in small leagues, records disappeared after the event ended.

  And I realized—these weren't just basketball issues. Friends who played football, volleyball, or badminton all faced the same challenges: lack of coordination, missing data, no way to build lasting recognition.

solution: |
  **AthleHub is a sports-first social hub that makes playing, tracking, and experiencing sports seamless.**

  - **Know when and where to play** with location-based match and event system
  - **Record and track stats** so every point, goal, or ace counts
  - **Stay connected** with your community through feeds, chat rooms, and events
  - **Recognize performance** with badges, leaderboards, and progression systems
  - **Enable credibility** for teams, players, and businesses to build visibility

mission: |
  To digitize grassroots sports and give athletes, communities, and organizations the same tools for recognition and engagement that professionals have — but accessible, fun, and social.

why_now: |
  The grassroots sports community is massive but underserved by technology. While professional sports have sophisticated tracking and engagement tools, amateur athletes are stuck with group chats, spreadsheets, and memory.

  Post-pandemic, there's a renewed focus on community and physical activity. People want to get back to playing sports, but they need better tools to coordinate and stay engaged. AthleHub bridges the gap between casual pickup games and organized sports, making every game count.

AthleHub represents the intersection of my love for sports and my technical skills. It's not just about building another sports app—it's about solving real coordination problems that affect millions of amateur athletes worldwide.

Every feature is designed around actual pain points I've experienced: the empty court, the lost game stats, the missed pickup game invitations. This isn't theoretical—it's personal.

The platform will start with basketball (my primary sport) but expand to support all team and individual sports. The goal is to create a unified ecosystem where grassroots sports communities can thrive with the same technological advantages that professional sports enjoy.
