# Interactive Trivia
trivia:
  - question: "What is the recommended minimum amount of moderate-intensity exercise per week for adults?"
    options:
      - text: "60 minutes"
        correct: false
      - text: "150 minutes"
        correct: true
      - text: "300 minutes"
        correct: false
      - text: "75 minutes"
        correct: false
    explanation: "The WHO recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week for adults to maintain good health and reduce disease risk."

  - question: "Which of these is NOT a compound exercise (an exercise that works multiple muscle groups)?"
    options:
      - text: "Bench Press"
        correct: false
      - text: "Bicep Curl"
        correct: true
      - text: "Squat"
        correct: false
      - text: "Deadlift"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Bicep curls are an isolation exercise, primarily targeting one muscle group (the biceps). Compound exercises like bench press, squat, and deadlift work multiple muscle groups simultaneously."

  - question: "What does 'progressive overload' mean in fitness?"
    options:
      - text: "Lifting as heavy as possible every workout"
        correct: false
      - text: "Gradually increasing training demands over time"
        correct: true
      - text: "Working out every single day"
        correct: false
      - text: "Only doing compound movements"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress placed on the body during exercise. This can be achieved by increasing weight, reps, sets, or decreasing rest time to continually challenge your muscles."

  - question: "How long should you rest between sets when training for strength?"
    options:
      - text: "30 seconds"
        correct: false
      - text: "1 minute"
        correct: false
      - text: "2-5 minutes"
        correct: true
      - text: "10 minutes"
        correct: false
    explanation: "For strength training with heavy weights, 2-5 minutes of rest between sets allows your muscles to recover enough ATP (energy) to perform at maximum capacity on the next set."

  - question: "Which macronutrient is most important for muscle recovery and growth?"
    options:
      - text: "Carbohydrates"
        correct: false
      - text: "Protein"
        correct: true
      - text: "Fats"
        correct: false
      - text: "Fiber"
        correct: false
    explanation: "Protein provides the amino acids necessary for muscle repair and growth. Most research suggests 1.6-2.2g of protein per kg of body weight for optimal muscle building."

## My Fitness Philosophy

For me, fitness is the totality of wellbeing‚Äîbody, mind, and soul. It's about being capable: capable of protecting the people you love, capable of clearing your mind under a heavy barbell, and capable of enjoying life without physical limitations. My philosophy is simple: **do what you can and want to do.** It's not about following the perfect program, but about showing up consistently and listening to what your body and mind need.

## The Journey: From Punishment to Purpose

My fitness journey started in the most unlikely way: as punishment from seniors in school. I quickly realized that this "punishment" was making me stronger and faster on the basketball court and football pitch. That spark of tangible improvement ignited a passion.

I eventually stepped into a gym with no direction, just a vague desire to be bigger. That desire crystallized into a powerful purpose: **to be strong enough to protect the people in my life.** That "why" has been my anchor through phases of intense focus and inevitable fall-offs. These days, you'll find me following a Push, Pull, Legs split, aiming for those concrete goals: a 120kg bench, 20 pull-ups, and the elusive muscle-up.

## The Gap in Fitness Tech

I've tried every fitness app on the market. They're great digital notebooks‚Äîexcellent at logging what I did. But they're terrible coaches. They don't tell me *what to do next* when I plateau for months. My progress photos are buried in my camera roll, and my notes are scattered across apps. I was putting in the work but missing the intelligence to make it count.

I'm not just building a better logbook. I'm building an intelligent partner for fitness‚Äîone that connects the dots between your effort, your nutrition, and your progress to provide real, actionable insights. Because the goal isn't just to be strong; it's to be smart about getting there.
