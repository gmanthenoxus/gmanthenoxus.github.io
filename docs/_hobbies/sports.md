## My Sports Journey

My story isn't one of specialized training or elite camps; it's a story of pure, undirected energy and a deep-seated need to move. From sprinting in nursery school to performing bicycle stunts on the street, sports have always been my constant. As a military kid who changed schools frequently, the universal language of a game, whether it was soccer on dusty roads or badminton with my dad. It was how I connected, how I settled in, and how I expressed myself.

The spark for basketball was almost accidental. Moving to a house right beside a court felt like fate. With no prior experience, I walked out, shot a ball, and watched my first bucket swish through the net. That was the moment. That simple success ignited a passion that has since expanded to include everything from the strategic duel of table tennis to the endurance test of long distance running. I've even attempted the high jump at 5'6" not for medals, but for the pure joy of trying.

## The Bond & The Problem

For me, sports have never been solely about competition. They're about the bonds forged on the pitch and the court. Some of my closest friends are people I met because of a shared drive to improve and a shared passion for the game. Sports are an unparalleled unit of unison, breaking down barriers of language, upbringing, and background.

But this beautiful community faces ugly frustrations. I've lost count of the times I've shown up to an empty court, heard about a pickup game too late, or watched the stats and stories of a great match disappear into thin air. This isn't just a basketball problem. My friends who play football, volleyball, and badminton all share the same pain: a lack of coordination, missing data, and no lasting recognition for the communities we build every time we play.

## The Vision

This frustration is where my passion meets my skills. I see a world where technology serves the casual athlete where finding a game is effortless, where your contributions are tracked and celebrated, and where the community thrives beyond the final whistle. My goal is to build that world, starting with the tools we wish we had.

### **What I'm Building**

**Athlehub** - A sports-first social platform that solves the coordination problem:
- **Find Games Instantly**: Real-time coordination for pickup games in your area
- **Track Your Journey**: Stats, achievements, and memories that don't disappear
- **Build Community**: Recognition and connection for casual athletes
- **Never Miss Out**: Notifications for games, events, and your sports community

### **The Impact I Want to Create**

- **For Players**: No more empty courts, missed games, or lost stats
- **For Communities**: Stronger bonds through better coordination and recognition
- **For the Sport**: Celebrating the casual athlete who plays for love of the game
- **For Technology**: Proving that the best tools serve real human needs

## Philosophy

Sports taught me that the best moments aren't always about winning‚Äîthey're about showing up, giving your all, and being part of something bigger than yourself. Whether it's a perfect assist, a hard-fought defensive stand, or just the joy of running with friends, these moments deserve to be remembered and celebrated.

The casual sports community is massive, passionate, and underserved. We deserve tools as good as the ones built for fantasy sports and professional analytics. That's what I'm building.
