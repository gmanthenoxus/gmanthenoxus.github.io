## My Anime Journey

My journey began in junior secondary school, fueled by the passionate discussions of my roommates. I took the plunge with *Bleach*, completely unaware of the massive world I was stepping into. The hook was set deep the first time Ichigo unleashed his Bankai. The sheer scale, the power shift, the visual spectacle‚Äîit was a defining "I get it now" moment that transformed me from a curious observer into a dedicated fan.

From there, I dove headfirst into the world of light novels and isekai. *Overlord* was my gateway drug. It wasn't just about the power fantasy; it was the adventure, the freedom to shape a world, the stunning beauty of its scenes, and the philosophical question of what one *does* with absolute power.

Now, I'm a daily consumer. My ritual is built on the mental patience to wait a week for a new episode, filled by restarting old favorites to catch missed plots and hunting for hidden gems. Anime is my companion for meals, my rest after work, and my perfect distraction. I've reached that point where it feels like there's no isekai left unseen.

## The Problem & The Passion

This deep dive has made the industry's pain points painfully clear. I've spent hours, like searching for the psychological sports masterpiece *One Outs*, only to find it tucked away on an obscure YouTube channel. Keeping up with seasonal releases is a part-time job, and there's no easy way to share the experience‚Äîto see what my friends are watching or to build a shared watchlist.

This frustration is where my passion for anime meets my skills as a builder. I see a world where better tools can make being a fan seamless and more social. My goal is to build that world.
