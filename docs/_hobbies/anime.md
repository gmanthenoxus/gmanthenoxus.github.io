# Anime

Welcome to my anime journey. Here you'll find my projects, reviews, and creations inspired by Japanese animation.

## My Anime Philosophy

Anime isn't just entertainmentâ€”it's a medium that can convey complex emotions, philosophical ideas, and cultural perspectives in ways that live-action often cannot.

## Favorite Series

- **Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** - Masterclass in storytelling
- **Spirited Away** - Studio Ghibli magic
- **Attack on Titan** - Dark themes with incredible character development
