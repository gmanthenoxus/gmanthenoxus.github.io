## My Music Philosophy

Music, to me, is life story portrayed in sound. Every song is a chapter from an artist's soul—whether through their lyrics, the rhythm they produce, or the beat they craft. I may not always remember the lyrics, but I remember how a song makes me feel. This emotional resonance is what transforms music from background noise into a powerful narrative force that scores our lives.

## The Journey: From Family Band to Daily Companion

My musical foundation was built early, learning to play the saxophone, piano, guitar, and clarinet. This technical understanding gave me a deep appreciation for the craft behind the art. At home, the soundtrack was a rich blend of heavy African rhythms from legends like Fela, mixed with the pop harmonies of Backstreet Boys and Westlife. This eclectic upbringing taught me that good music knows no genre boundaries.

Today, music is my ultimate utility player. It's the ginger that fuels my gym sessions, the outlet that helps me process emotions, the focus booster for deep work, and the perfect companion on casual strolls. I've embraced being a musical explorer, constantly asking friends to curate playlists for different experiences and happily diving into Spotify's shuffle to discover new sounds.

## The Vision: Smarter Music Discovery

My current favorites, J. Cole and Burna Boy, represent the blend of storytelling and rhythm I love. But my true passion lies in fixing how we discover and share music. Why should our playlists be so siloed? Why can't our music adapt to what we're doing and how we're feeling, rather than just what we've listened to before?

I envision tools that make music social again—not locked to one platform, but fluid across services. Tools that understand that sometimes you need a pump-up playlist for the gym, and other times you need a calming soundtrack for a walk. The future of music tech isn't just about bigger libraries; it's about smarter, more contextual, and more human listening experiences.
