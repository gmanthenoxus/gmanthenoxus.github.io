## My Footwear Philosophy

For me, shoes are about artistic expression and comfort in equal measure. I'm not chasing hype or trying to compete with serious collectors‚ÄîI simply love the experience of finding the perfect pair. Whether it's for fashion, sports, or work, I believe in wearing your kicks and enjoying them. My approach balances reliability, comfort, aesthetic appeal, and price point to find shoes that truly work for my life.

## The Collection & The Hunt

With over 15 pairs in my current rotation (heavily featuring Adidas, but I'm not brand-loyal), I've developed a keen eye for what works. My collection is practical yet expressive, and my wishlist reflects my diverse taste‚Äîfrom the sleek lines of Jordan 1 Lows to the rugged appeal of Timberlands, the innovative design of Yeezys, and the classic comfort of Chelsea boots.

But my journey hasn't been without its challenges. As someone with size 44 feet, I've experienced the frustrating reality of inconsistent sizing across brands and even within the same brand. This has given me a unique talent: I can look at someone's feet and accurately guess their shoe size‚Äîa skill born from paying close attention to the nuances of fit and proportion.

## The Vision: Solving Real Footwear Problems

My experiences have shown me the gaps in the footwear world. Why should finding the right size be such a gamble? Why isn't there a better way to track what works and what doesn't across different brands and models?

I envision tools that make footwear shopping more reliable and collecting more organized. From a universal sizing database powered by real wearer experiences to a smart collection tracker that helps you plan your next purchase, I'm passionate about building solutions that serve both practical needs and personal expression.

After all, if I'm going to spend my last dollar on shoes, they better fit perfectly.
