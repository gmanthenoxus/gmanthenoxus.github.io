# Why I Build With My Hobbies

Building at the intersection of passion and skill creates something truly unique.

## The Spark

Every great project starts with genuine interest. When you're passionate about something, you're willing to spend countless hours perfecting it, debugging it, and making it better.

## The Process

My development process looks different for each hobby:

### Anime Projects
- Focus on community and sharing
- Emphasis on storytelling and emotional connection
- Built for social platforms like Discord

### Sneaker Projects
- Focus on utility and practicality
- Emphasis on real-time data and notifications
- Built for personal use and sharing with collectors

## The Result

When passion drives development, the end product isn't just functionalâ€”it's meaningful. Users can feel the care and attention that went into every detail.

## Moving Forward

I encourage everyone to build something they're passionate about. The best projects come from the heart, not just the mind.
