# From Collector to Creator: My Development Journey

Sometimes the best career paths are the ones you never planned.

## The Collector Phase

I started as a collector - sneakers, anime figures, trading cards. I loved the hunt, the community, the stories behind each piece. But I always felt like I was consuming rather than creating.

## The Spark

The turning point came when I couldn't find the tools I needed as a collector:
- **Sneaker release calendars** that actually worked
- **Anime tracking apps** that understood my taste
- **Community platforms** that felt genuine

So I decided to build them myself.

## Learning to Code

### The Early Days
- Started with HTML/CSS to build simple landing pages
- Moved to JavaScript for interactivity
- Discovered APIs and databases for real functionality

### The Breakthrough Moment
When I deployed my first sneaker tracker and saw other collectors actually using it - that's when I knew I'd found my calling.

## From Hobby to Career

### Building a Portfolio
Each hobby project became a portfolio piece:
- **Sneaker Release Tracker** → Full-stack development skills
- **Anime Recommendation Engine** → Machine learning and data science
- **Trading Card Price Monitor** → Real-time data processing

### The Job Search
Having real projects that solved real problems made interviews completely different. Instead of theoretical questions, we talked about actual challenges I'd solved.

## Key Insights

### 1. Passion Projects Stand Out
Employers can tell when you've built something because you cared about it, not just because you had to.

### 2. Community Matters
The communities around my hobbies became my first users, my feedback providers, and eventually my professional network.

### 3. Problems Are Opportunities
Every frustration I had as a collector became a feature in my applications.

## Where I Am Now

Today, I work as a developer professionally, but I still build hobby projects. The difference is now I have the skills to build exactly what I envision.

## Advice for Others

If you're passionate about something, there's probably a way to build around it. Start small, solve your own problems first, and don't be afraid to share your work.
