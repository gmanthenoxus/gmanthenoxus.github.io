# Step-by-step process
process_steps:
  - title: "Planning and Research"
    description: |
      Spent 2 weeks researching different layouts, switch types, and keycap profiles. Decided on 75% layout for the perfect balance of functionality and desk space.
      
      Key decisions:
      - 75% layout for arrow keys and function row
      - Linear switches for smooth gaming
      - South-facing PCB for better keycap compatibility
    time_required: "2 weeks"
    tips:
      - "Join r/MechanicalKeyboards for community advice"
      - "Try different switches at a local store first"
      - "Consider your primary use case (gaming vs typing)"

  - title: "Sourcing Components"
    description: |
      Ordered all components from reputable vendors. Had to wait 3 weeks for the GMK keycaps due to high demand.
      
      Vendors used:
      - Glorious Gaming (keyboard kit)
      - Divinikey (switches and tools)
      - NovelKeys (keycaps and accessories)
    time_required: "1 day ordering, 3 weeks waiting"
    tips:
      - "Order keycaps first - they take longest to ship"
      - "Buy 10% extra switches for spares"
      - "Check compatibility between all components"

  - title: "Switch Installation"
    description: |
      Installed 82 switches into the hot-swap PCB. The GMMK Pro uses 3-pin and 5-pin switch compatibility.
      
      Process:
      1. Test PCB with VIA software
      2. Install stabilizers with proper lubrication
      3. Insert switches ensuring proper alignment
      4. Test each switch for proper registration
    image: "/assets/images/switch-installation.jpg"
    time_required: "2 hours"
    tips:
      - "Test every switch before final assembly"
      - "Use a switch puller for adjustments"
      - "Ensure switches are fully seated"

  - title: "Stabilizer Tuning"
    description: |
      Properly tuned stabilizers are crucial for a premium feel. Lubricated with Krytox 205g0 and added band-aid mod for reduced rattle.
      
      Modifications:
      - Clipped stabilizer legs for better fit
      - Lubricated wire and housing contact points
      - Applied band-aid mod to PCB mounting points
    time_required: "1.5 hours"
    tips:
      - "Less is more with stabilizer lube"
      - "Test spacebar feel after each adjustment"
      - "Band-aid mod significantly reduces rattle"

  - title: "Final Assembly and Testing"
    description: |
      Assembled the complete keyboard and spent time fine-tuning the typing experience through software customization.
      
      Final steps:
      1. Install keycaps with proper alignment
      2. Program custom layout with VIA
      3. Adjust RGB lighting and rotary knob functions
      4. Extended typing test and adjustments

# The Journey to My Perfect Keyboard

As a developer who spends 8+ hours a day typing, I've always been fascinated by the tools that connect my thoughts to the screen. After years of using standard keyboards, I finally decided to dive into the world of custom mechanical keyboards and build something truly personal.

## Why Go Custom?

The mechanical keyboard hobby might seem excessive to outsiders, but there are real benefits:

### Typing Experience
- **Tactile feedback**: Every keypress feels intentional and satisfying
- **Consistency**: Each key has the same actuation force and travel
- **Durability**: Quality switches are rated for 50+ million keypresses

### Customization
- **Layout optimization**: Remove unused keys, add macros where needed
- **Switch selection**: Choose the exact feel and sound you prefer
- **Aesthetic control**: Create a keyboard that matches your style

### Learning Experience
- **Electronics knowledge**: Understanding PCBs, switches, and firmware
- **Fine motor skills**: Precision assembly and adjustment
- **Community engagement**: Joining a passionate, helpful community

## The Planning Phase

Choosing components for a custom keyboard can be overwhelming. Here's how I approached it:

### Layout Selection
I chose 75% because it offers:
- **Compact footprint**: Saves desk space compared to full-size
- **Function keys**: Essential for development work
- **Arrow keys**: Crucial for navigation and gaming
- **Dedicated delete key**: More convenient than Fn combinations

### Switch Research
After testing various switches at a local store, I settled on Gateron Oil Kings:
- **Linear feel**: Smooth travel without tactile bump
- **Medium weight**: 55g actuation force for balanced typing
- **Factory lubed**: Smooth operation out of the box
- **Excellent reputation**: Consistently praised in the community

## The Build Process

### Preparation is Key
Before touching any components, I:
- Watched multiple build guides for my specific keyboard
- Prepared a clean, well-lit workspace
- Gathered all necessary tools (screwdrivers, switch puller, keycap puller)
- Downloaded and tested the configuration software (VIA)

### Assembly Challenges
The most challenging part was stabilizer tuning. These components affect the feel of larger keys (spacebar, shift, enter), and getting them right requires patience:

1. **Initial test**: Spacebar felt mushy and inconsistent
2. **Disassembly**: Removed keycaps and switches to access stabilizers
3. **Lubrication**: Applied thin layer of Krytox 205g0 to contact points
4. **Band-aid mod**: Added foam tape to reduce rattle
5. **Reassembly and testing**: Much improved feel and sound

### Programming and Customization
Using VIA software, I created a custom layout optimized for my workflow:
- **Layer 0**: Standard QWERTY with minor modifications
- **Layer 1**: Function keys, media controls, and RGB settings
- **Layer 2**: Programming symbols and shortcuts
- **Rotary knob**: Volume control with push-to-mute

## Living with the Custom Keyboard

After three months of daily use, here are my observations:

### Productivity Impact
- **Typing speed**: Increased from 85 WPM to 95 WPM
- **Accuracy**: Fewer typos due to consistent key feel
- **Comfort**: Less finger fatigue during long coding sessions
- **Satisfaction**: Genuine enjoyment from the typing experience

### Unexpected Benefits
- **Conversation starter**: Colleagues often ask about the unique keyboard
- **Attention to tools**: Increased awareness of other workspace ergonomics
- **Community connection**: Joined online forums and local meetups
- **Gateway hobby**: Led to interest in other DIY electronics projects

## Lessons Learned

### What I'd Do Differently
- **Start with a switch tester**: Would have saved time and money
- **Budget for extras**: Always need spare switches and keycaps
- **Consider sound**: Didn't realize how much keyboard sound matters in shared spaces
- **Plan for iteration**: This won't be my last custom keyboard

### Advice for Beginners
- **Start simple**: Don't overcomplicate your first build
- **Join the community**: r/MechanicalKeyboards is incredibly helpful
- **Budget realistically**: Quality components cost more but last longer
- **Enjoy the process**: The journey is as rewarding as the destination

## The Rabbit Hole Continues

Building this keyboard opened up a whole new world of customization and craftsmanship. I'm already planning my next build‚Äîa split ergonomic keyboard for even better typing ergonomics.

The mechanical keyboard hobby teaches patience, attention to detail, and the value of quality tools. More than that, it's a reminder that the things we use every day deserve thoughtful consideration and personal touch.

Whether you're a developer, writer, or anyone who spends significant time typing, I encourage you to explore what a custom keyboard might offer. Your fingers (and your productivity) might thank you! ‚å®Ô∏è‚ú®
