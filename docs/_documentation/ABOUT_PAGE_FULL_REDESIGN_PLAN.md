## 📝 Detailed Changes

### Section 3: My Story - New Content

**Old**:
```
Started from a love of mathematics and problem-solving, which naturally led to 
using computers and then learning to code. Developed solid programming fundamentals 
and transferable skills. Have created tailor-made websites and tools for organizations 
across various industries.

Currently pursuing a Master's in Information Technology with Data Science specialization 
and on a journey of self-discovery while training others who are eager to learn.

[Generic Marc Anthony quote]
```

**New**:
```
My journey started with a simple fascination: how can we use logic to solve any problem? 
That question led me from mathematics to computers, and eventually to code. What began 
as curiosity became a passion when I realized I could build tools that actually solve 
real problems for real people.

Over the past 3+ years, I've built custom solutions for organizations across different 
industries, but something was missing. I was solving everyone else's problems while my 
own passions sat on the back burner. That's when the 49 Project Quest was born—a 
commitment to build meaningful projects across all 7 of my core interests.

Now I'm pursuing a Master's in IT with Data Science specialization, not just to level 
up my skills, but to bring data-driven thinking to everything I build. Whether it's 
tracking anime watch stats or optimizing fantasy sports lineups, I'm learning to merge 
technical expertise with genuine passion.

[Personal insight: "The best projects aren't the ones that look good in a portfolio—
they're the ones that solve problems you actually care about."]
```

    and scalable architecture.</p>
