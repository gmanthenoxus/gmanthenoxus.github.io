# Conflicting Styles - Summary & Solution üîç

## Problem Found

The project card styles are not working because there are **~200 lines of old Option A, B, C styles** still in `_hobby-page.scss` that are conflicting with the clean design.

---

## What's Happening

### **Multiple `.project-card` Definitions**:
1. **Line 2438**: Wrong `.project-card` (merged with old `.btn-primary` styles)
2. **Line 2621**: **Correct `.project-card`** with `background: white` ‚úÖ

### **The Issue**:
- Old option styles (Option A, B, C) from lines 2438-2615
- These are overriding the new clean styles
- CSS cascade picks the last definition

---

## Solution

**Remove lines 2434-2615** (all old option styles) and keep only the clean design starting at line 2621.

### **What to Remove**:
```
Lines 2434-2615:
- Old `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-icon` styles
- `.visual-*` styles
- `.project-card-visual` styles  
- `.kanban-*` styles
- All Option A, B, C remnants
```

### **What to Keep**:
```
Line 2621+: Clean `.project-card` with:
- background: white
- border: 1px solid #e5e7eb
- flex-direction: column
```

## Quick Fix

Since the file has many nested old styles that are difficult to remove incrementally, here's the quickest solution:

### **Option 1: Manual Edit** (Recommended)
1. Open `docs/_sass/_hobby-page.scss`
2. Find line 2434 (search for "CLEAN PROJECT CARDS")
3. Delete everything from line 2434 to line 2615
4. Keep the second "CLEAN PROJECT CARDS" section (line 2621+)

### **Option 2: Test Current State**
The clean styles ARE in the file (starting at line 2621). They might work if the old styles don't override them. Let's test:

1. Refresh the browser
2. Check if the project cards look correct
3. If not, we'll need to manually remove the old styles

---

## Expected Result

After removing old styles, the project cards should have:
- ‚úÖ Clean white background
- ‚úÖ Title and status stacked vertically (no overlap)
- ‚úÖ Tech tags with hobby color theme
- ‚úÖ Gradient outline buttons
- ‚úÖ Proper spacing and alignment

---

## Files Affected

**`docs/_sass/_hobby-page.scss`**
- Lines 2434-2615: Old option styles (REMOVE)
- Lines 2621+: Clean styles (KEEP)

---

**Let's test the current state first, then decide if manual cleanup is needed!**
